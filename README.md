## Project Description / Background

This project is part of CalEPA's racial equity data team, and aims to explore the demographics of California's state government workforce (we can potentially add more information about the project here, e.g., a description of the project background and goals, documentation of where the raw/source data came from, instructions for running the scripts, description of intermediate and final outputs, etc.).

## Source Data

The workforce data used in this project comes from [CalHR's Statewide 5102 report](https://www.calhr.ca.gov/pages/statewide-reports.aspx). A cleaned and compiled version of that data is available on the California Open Data Portal at: <https://data.ca.gov/dataset/calhr-civil-rights-data-for-gare-capital-cohort-2019>
